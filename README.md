# Hopstial Sample Monitoring Program
 This is a final year project created for the use in Hospital laboratories. 
 
## How to use
  The program uses csv data which is generated from laboratory systems. 
  Test files are located in the folders for use outside of a laboratory enviornment.

  gets updated very minute and will alert if a sample exceeds a delay timer set in the settings page.
  The report page needs a different file to be selected then a date range within the file can be put in the date fields.
  A graph will be generated and a PNG file will be saved on the system. Statistics will be displayed on the screen as well.
